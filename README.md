# Data Analysis projects 
This repository will be used to hold all of the projects that I'm working on that are based on Excel and SQL. 
 
## Projects that are posted: 
### Employee Burnout analysis 
- An analysis based on the dataset created by HackerEarth. It was for a competition that asked contestants to predict employee burnout due to their Burn Rate and     other various conditions that may affect it. I used SQL and Tableau for this analysis. 

### Airplane Passenger Satisfaction analysis  
- An analysis that analyzed Airplane passenger satisfaction through various different conditions, such as In-Flight service, flight distance, and etc. The dataset     was created by Maven Analytics. I used Microsoft Excel for this analysis. 

### Mexican Toy Sales analysis 
- An analysis based on toy sales and profits in Mexico. I find seasonal trends, top toy products, and the value of the stores inventory. I also recommend how to reach peak profit due to certain relationships that caused high profits in the data. 

### LeBron James Career analysis 
- An analysis on LeBron James and his career and how his game has evolved over the last 20 years!!! Very fun project that consists of a dashboard from Tableau and a pdf of the analysis. This was just a really fun project where I didn't really want to stress over too much, but as an NBA fan, I really enjoyed working on it and taking a break from your average analysis in business.
