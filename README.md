# Data Analysis projects 
This repository will be used to hold all of the projects that I'm working on that are based on Excel and SQL. 
 
## Projects that are posted: 
### Employee Burnout analysis 
- An analysis based on the dataset created by HackerEarth. It was for a competition that asked contestants to predict employee burnout due to their Burn Rate and     other various conditions that may affect it. I used SQL and Tableau for this analysis. 

### Airplane Passenger Satisfaction analysis  
- An analysis that analyzed Airplane passenger satisfaction through various different conditions, such as In-Flight service, flight distance, and etc. The dataset     was created by Maven Analytics. I used Microsoft Excel for this analysis.
